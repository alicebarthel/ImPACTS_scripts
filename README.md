# ImPACTS_scripts
Repository to hold scripts relevant for the ImPACTS project

All simulations MUST use a run script and zppy script for plotting.  There are templates for each in the templates/ folder.

Place all run related scripts (run and zppy) in the 'simulation_scripts_archive' directory.

Any other plotting scripts (not zppy plotting) -- custom plot scripts should go in analysis_scripts_archive for sharing and later hardening for inclusion in more simulations
